## The colorblindpalette
#### The purpose of this package is to create a red/green color blind-friendly color palette. 
While I am not colorblind, I firmly believe that visualizations should be accessible to all. 

##### Code.Rmd 
This is where the code for the package is located. Inside is the class information, along with functions that define the package. As of Nov 29th, 2024, only three colors can be selected at a time. 

##### Install 
```md
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kenedyducheine/colorblindpalette")
```
